# Day-One
Global Game Jam 2020, made entirely by two programmers (https://github.com/JIMBLYB, https://github.com/DanielNeale). 
(Made using a local BitBucket server so no commits here)

A software developer desperately tries to fix their project and commit a day one patch. Fix the corrupted files one by one by patching bugs through manically mashing the keyboard. Your newly released project is unexpectedly filled with bugs that corrupt it! You can't pass these off as features so you have to find and patch as many as you can before they manage to take up your ram and slow your computer to a grinding halt!
